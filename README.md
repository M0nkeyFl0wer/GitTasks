# GitTasks

**GitTasks** is a lightweight, open-source task manager built around GitHub Issues. It turns your repos into usable to-do lists that actually work on your phone, offline, or with your favorite Markdown setup.

This project is the foundation of a broader open productivity system: it's the **task layer**. Not some all-in-one monster app—just a clean, focused tool for wrangling what needs doing.

## Why this matters

If you’ve ever tried to manage your day from inside GitHub... bless you. Issues are powerful but they’re not exactly mobile-friendly or good for daily planning. And most task apps ignore GitHub entirely, or try to reinvent it.

GitTasks respects the repo as source of truth, but gives you a better way to interact with your tasks—on your phone, offline, or from a terminal. Plus, it plays nice with real calendars, Markdown, and other open tools.

## Core Features (MVP)

- Pull GitHub Issues (title, body, labels, state)
- Show them as clean tasks in a mobile/web UI
- Complete tasks → close issues or apply a label
- Export to Markdown, ICS, or sync with CalDAV
- Optional sync with [Tasks.org](https://tasks.org) or Nextcloud Tasks

---

## What It Works With

- [Schedulr](https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/Schedulr): our local-first, AI-powered time-blocking assistant
- GitHub CLI, Markdown files, Obsidian vaults
- Nextcloud Tasks or CalDAV servers
- Offline-first workflows (works great on Termux or mobile)

## Project Status

Active development. Issues and roadmap coming soon. Looking for collaborators, testers, and people who hate overly complicated planning apps as much as we do.

See [open issues](https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/GitTasks/issues) for stuff that needs doing. Some are even labeled “good first issue” if you’re feeling brave.

## Future Ideas

(We’re trying to keep scope tight, but these are in the dream drawer.)

- Markdown editor with smart issue linking
- Task filtering by label/project/user
- Integration with local Git commits or branch tracking
- A full terminal UI for you `task ls` freaks

## Support the project

If GitTasks helps you ship and stay focused:

**ETH:** `0xYourAddressHere`  
**Ko-fi:** [ko-fi.com/yourname](https://ko-fi.com/yourname)  
**Bluesky:** `@yourhandle.bsky.social`

Spare change = more time to build cool stuff instead of chasing contracts.
